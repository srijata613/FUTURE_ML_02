*Overview*

This project is a **Customer Churn Prediction System** designed to predict which customers are likely to stop using a service.
It helps businesses, such as banks, telecoms, and subscription services, identify high-risk customers and take proactive retention measures.

The app is built with **Python**, **Streamlit**, and a **machine learning model (XGBoost)** trained on real customer data.

---

*Features*

* Predicts churn probability for individual customers
* Input forms for customer demographic and account details
* Displays actionable messages based on prediction:

   ‚úÖ Likely to stay
   ‚ö†Ô∏è Likely to churn
* Feature importance visualization (optional with matplotlib)
* Scalable and lightweight web interface using Streamlit
